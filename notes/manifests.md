## Manifests
This includes everything from how many instances to create and how much memory to allocate to what services applications should use.

**A manifest can help you automate deployment, especially of multiple applications at once.**

- Manifests are written in YAML.
- The manifest may begin with three dashes.
- The applications block begins with a heading followed by a colon.
- The application name is preceded by a single dash and one space.
- Subsequent lines in the block are indented two spaces to align with name.

Example:
```yaml
---
applications:
- name: nifty-gui
  memory: 512M
  host: nifty
```
**Notes:**
- A minimal manifest requires only an application name.
If you do not use a manifest, the minimal push command looks like this:
```shell
$ cf push my-app
```
- Manifests override most recent values, including defaults.
- Command line options override manifests.

Example:
the ```cf scale``` command changes the number of instances.(override manifests.)
